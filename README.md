## Run this locally

Clone this repo and use either yarn or npm to install all of the dependencies.

## What does this do?

This application establishes several routes for each "fan" who enters the stadium. As an administrator, you get to choose which part of the stadium you want to get the video streams from.

Every time an administrator clicks on a section of the stadium, the fans in that section are given a popup to share their video.

If they provide the permission to share, the feed is sent to the administrator. The administrator can choose to clear the stream queue or let the fans keep sending their video

The purpose of this application was to crowd source the video feed of the game from the people in the game from different angles.

## Features to be implemented given more time/ more money

- Ability for the administrator to choose his/her favorite video from the respective section and use that for game's livestream.
- Ability for the administrator to choose videos to create a highlight reel.
